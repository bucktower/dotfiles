# Buck's Dotfiles

Going for cross-platform compatability of standard configurations for things like Vim

## Setup

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) if you haven't already
2. `cd $HOME`
3. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:bucktower/dotfiles.git`

If you've never used the [command line](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/) before, here's the application you're looking for:

  - Linux: Terminal
  - Mac: Terminal
  - Windows: Powershell

*(Markdown doesn't currently support ordered lists starting at an arbitrary number like 4, so just look for your OS and continue the OS-specific setup process)*

### Windows

4. `cd dotfiles`
5. `.\WindowsSetup.ps1`
  - This is a Powershell script that I have written to do all the setup. Go do something outside now while I handle the setup
